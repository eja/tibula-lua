Tibula	Copyright (C) 2007-2016 by Ubaldo Porcheddu <ubaldo@eja.it>


Tibula is a database web application framework based on eja micro web server.

It can be used as a standalone application or as an eja library.

To compile it run "make mysql" or "make sqlite3" depending on which database
you prefer. This will download, compile and install eja, luasql and tibula
itself.

To compile and install just the library run "make tibula".


A demo tibula.sql is also available and can be easily imported into mysql or
sqlite3, for instance as:

 sqlite3 /var/eja/tibula.db3 < tibula.sql

it can then be started with the following command:
 
 eja --tibula-start --sql-type sqlite3 --sql-database /var/eja/tibula.db3 --log-level 3

and accessed via browser at http://localhost:35248/eja.tibula as admin/eja.it .
